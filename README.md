1. The DFBN joint distribution is implemented as the composition of an Autoregressive Logistic Regression, a Fuzzy Inference Layer, and an FG-LSTM Encoder.
2. The Fuzzy inference layer includes gaze feature extraction, fuzzy clustering + membership function fitting, unsupervised Wang-Mender rule extraction, and Mamdani inference.
3. The detailed mathematical principles will be published after the paper is published.
